  Hello there! 🤙

### My name is João Artur

I'm a software developer, but considering you're here, you probably already knew that.

Here are some things you might not know about me:

- I'm Brazilian. 🇧🇷
- I am majoring Computer Science at the Federal Rural University of the Semi-Arid. 🎓
- I develop software as a way to improve my life and help other people. (And also because it's fun!) 🤝
- I'm always learning some new technology. 💻

These are some languages I have a bit of experience with:
